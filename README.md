# Final Project Generasi GIGIH 2.0 - This-Idk-Spotify-Wannabe ?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).\
This project was build especially for my Final Project Assignment at GenerasiGIGIH 2.0 ... And yes you did not get the name wrong (I have bad naming sense).\

## App flow

The flow for running the app is as such.

First install all the dependencies using:
```bash
npm install <insert dependencies here>
```

Then you can setup the environment using your own spotify API key at your `env.local`
```bash
REACT_APP_SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = <your spotify API key here>
```

Run the server using
```bash
npm start
```

Then after it has been started, you can check it on your Localhost(https://localhost:3000)

## Available Features

In the project directory, you can:
- See user profile
- Search for your favorite Tracks, Albums, or Artists. Just like in Spotify.
- Make a playlist with your selected tracks.
